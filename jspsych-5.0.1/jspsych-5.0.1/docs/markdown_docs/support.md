# Support

For questions about jsPsych, the preferred method of support is the [jsPsych google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jspsych). While I'm happy to answer e-mails about the library, I prefer to do it in a public forum so that an archive of questions and answers is created. Messages posted to the group go straight to my inbox, so it's just as fast as emailing me.

If you have identified a problem with the library itself, such as a bug in the code or an error in the documentation, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/issues) on the GitHub site. Please don't use the issue tracker for questions about how to use the library.
